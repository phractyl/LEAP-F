# LEAP-F
A lexicon-based approach to emotion analysis in a given document file. 

__LEAP-F__ (*L*exicon-based *E*motion *A*nalysis *P*rogram - *F*ile) uses the 2016 National Research Council Canada's Emotion lexicon to scan through a given document file. Users supply the document file in a popup window (using .txt or .rtf); this is a modified version of an existing program.

This provides a printed (text) output that you can export into whatever data visualization program of your choice.
